# CryptoTradingBot

A terminal based Coinbase Trading bot I made in 2020. This was a personal project I made during the crypto currency craze that utilizes a websocket connection to coinbasepro to buy and sell specified tokens. You can look at historical data for your selected token and choose a trading strategy for it. This was a project I did in my free time in the beginning of my coding journey, so while it can be much, much better, I did make a small profit with it, so I call it a mini success.
